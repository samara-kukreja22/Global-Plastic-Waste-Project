    <h1>Global Plastic Waste Infographic</h1>
    <section id="definitions">
      <h2>Definitions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mismanaged plastic waste: plastic waste that is not formally managed. For example, littered waste, and waste in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills that could leak into the ocean. </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>Evaluation: </h3>
      <h4>Achievability:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>This wireframe seems pretty achievabile. While it sets a plan that engages meaninfully with the data, it doesn't overcomplicate things.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Understandability:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Modeling: the model is accurate and the color coded scale allows readers to develop a conceptual model of the system. On the down side, the microsummary does nto include enough information for the reader to develop a conceptual understanding of the system- while the map is there, it doesn't serve any real purpose in the microsummary. Maybe the microsummary shouldn't include a map at all. Perhpas something like a bar chart or pie chart would be more effective in conveying information than the bullet points and country map sketched out here. </li>
        <li>Accuracy: while the macrosummary model is accurate because the map is to scale and the data is correct, it doesn't include a lot of information.</li>
        <li>Visibility: not every country is color coded or highlighted on the macrosummary map, which means that important elements of the system are excluded from the design.</li>
        <li>Consistency + simplicity: though the macrosummary might have benfitted from more signifiers, the infographic is simple to interact with regardless of skill level or knowledge of the system.</li>
      </ul>
        <h4>Usability:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Flexibility: our infographic doesn't cater to a variety of individual preferences and abilities nor does the level of interaction with the infographic vary based on user experience.</li>
        <li>Ease: both the macrosummary and microsummary pages can be navigated with relative ease.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Discoverability:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Affordances + signifiers: though there are several affordances within the infographic, they aren't very well signified in either the macro or microsummary pages.</li>
        <li>Constraints: the constraints are clear because one wouldn't be able to interact with the infographic in an unwanted way because of the layout of the map.</li>
        <li>Mapping: the mapping needs a lot of work! For example, how are the macrosummary and microsummary connected within the system?</li>
      </ul>
